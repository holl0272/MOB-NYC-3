APP DESCRIPTION
//////////////////////////

  >> Fact:

    At any given time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, there are 10-20 A.A. meetings being held in NYC, the surrounding burrows and counties within the Tri-state.

  >> A.A.Groups in the Tri-State:

    New York
      Manhattan: 372
      Queens: 203
      Brooklyn: 191
      Bronx: 101
      Nassau: 88
      Staten Island: 93
      Suffolk: 57
      Westchester: 160
      Orange: 40
      Putnam/Dutches: 38
      Rockland: 37
      Sullivan/Green/Ulster: 15

    New Jersey: 19
    Connecticut: 15

    TOTAL: 1429

  >> Number of Meetings:

    TOTAL: 3679

  >> Data Source:

    Parsed from http://www.nyintergroup.org/
    I've already built the DB which houses this parsed data

  >> Problem/Issue:

    Finding a meeting is difficult...

    The sole resource is published by the Inter-group organization in two mediums:

      1) A directory, printed on flimsy paper with a two staple binding.  Any printed material is inherently outdated and cumbersome to carry on your person.  It's easily destroyed through light wear and tear and next to impossible to search through it's poorly laid out hierarchy.

      2) A website, which is difficult to navigate, out dated and not mobile friendly.

  >> App Solution:

    Through geo location, the app will drop pins at the location of meetings within the user's proximity based on the time of day.

  >> Example:

    It's 6:40pm and the user is standing on the corner of 8th Ave and 14th street.  Within 4 blocks, 3 pins are dropped for meetings beginning at 7pm.

    Expand the range and within 6 blocks, 7 pins are dropped.

    There are 5 meetings within this range, however, are not shown because they began at 6:30.

    Tapping on any one pin will display the meetings particulars:

      - Group Name
      - Address/Location
      - Special Directions
      - Days/Hours
      - Types of Meetings:
          Beginners meeting
          Big Book meeting
          Closed Discussion meeting
          Step meeting
          Tradition meeting
          Open meeting
          Open Discussion meeting
      - Accessibility:
          Spanish speaking group
          Wheelchair accessible meeting place
